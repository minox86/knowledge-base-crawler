- [ ] 6.3. Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] 6.4. Configure job queue and processing logic
- [ ] 6.5. Set up data source abstractions
- [ ] 6.6. Configure ESLint and Prettier

### 7. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] 7.1. Create `packages/integration-tests` package
- [ ] 7.2. Configure Jest/Vitest for integration testing
- [ ] 7.3. Set up test utilities for cross-service testing
- [ ] 7.4. Configure unit testing for each package
- [ ] 7.5. Set up test scripts in root package.json

### 8. Build and Development Configuration
- [ ] 8.1. Configure TypeScript project references for the entire monorepo
- [ ] 8.2. Set up development scripts for concurrent package development
- [ ] 8.3. Configure linting and formatting scripts
- [ ] 8.4. Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality

### 10. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- [ ] 10.1. Update GitLab CI/CD configuration for monorepo
- [ ] 10.2. Configure independent deployment pipelines per service
- [ ] 10.3. Set up dependency change detection for efficient builds
- [ ] 10.4. Configure automated testing for all packages

### 11. Documentation Updates
- [ ] 11.1. Update README.md with monorepo setup instructions
- [ ] 11.2. Create development guide for working with the monorepo
- [ ] 11.3. Document shared library usage patterns
- [ ] 11.4. Update deployment documentation for independent services

### 12. Dependency Management
- [ ] 12.1. Configure shared dependencies in root package.json
- [ ] 12.2. Set up package-specific dependencies
- [ ] 12.3. Configure peer dependencies for shared libraries
- [ ] 12.4. Optimize dependency deduplication with pnpm

### 13. Environment Configuration
- [ ] 13.1. Set up environment variable management per service
- [ ] 13.2. Configure shared environment variables
- [ ] 13.3. Set up development environment configuration
- [ ] 13.4. Configure production environment variables

### 14. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] 14.1. Configure OpenTelemetry for each service
- [ ] 14.2. Set up shared monitoring utilities
- [ ] 14.3. Configure logging standards across services
- [ ] 14.4. Set up health check endpoints for each service

### 15. Final Integration and Testing
- [ ] 15.1. Verify all packages build successfully
- [ ] 15.2. Test cross-package dependencies
- [ ] 15.3. Run integration tests across all services
- [ ] 15.4. Test CI/CD pipeline with the new structure

## Success Criteria
- All services can be built and deployed independently
- Shared libraries are properly consumed by applications
- Testing infrastructure covers both unit and integration testing
- CI/CD pipeline works efficiently with change detection
- Development experience is streamlined with pnpm workspaces

## Technologies Used
- **Package Manager**: pnpm workspaces
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI/CD with independent service pipelines
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry

# Summary

## 1. Workspace Configuration

Successfully created monorepo foundation with pnpm workspaces, configured strict dependency management, and established development tooling for TypeScript/ESLint across all future packages.

## 2. Directory Structure Setup

Created the essential monorepo directory structure with `packages/apps/` for deployable applications and `packages/libs/` for shared libraries. The `.gitignore` file was already properly configured for the monorepo structure with appropriate exclusions for package builds and distributions.

## 3. Shared Libraries Creation

Successfully created two foundational shared libraries:
- **@knowledge-crawler/types**: Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for data sources, documents, vector databases, API responses, and search functionality
- **@knowledge-crawler/utils**: Essential utility functions for string manipulation, date handling, object operations, array utilities, validation, async helpers, and environment variable management

Both packages are properly configured with TypeScript project references, build successfully to `lib/` directories with declarations and source maps, and include appropriate dependency management through pnpm workspaces.
